# Experiment Rust

A repository to play around Rust.

## Why Rust

- It is strongly typed and compiled, thus making it type safe
- The programming language can be used to write system related program
- According to the community, it is blazingly fast!!
- Want to try WASM for web app development that can be achieved by Rust
- With the performance, Rust might be a good candidate to develop pentesting / threat detection related tool
- The setup is pretty easy

## Just my personal preference/opinion

- setting up Rust is easier than Python, because the package manager `cargo` is already included in the setup rust, while python needs pip setup separately.
- The directory structure does not need to follow specific structure like Go.
- running the final product does not need the runtime or SDK like Java, C# dot NET, or NodeJS
